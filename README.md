# Plantr

Plantr is a church outreach management app that allows for better organization and tracking efforts of church outreach missions.

## The Purpose

The idea for Plantr came from the church I attend.  We have members who participate in local flea market mission work.  This work is
aimed at handing out tracts, inviting people to services, and (if they are willing) sign them up for a bible correspondence course.
The current system of keeping track of who was signed up, who was on which course, etc. became a burdensome task with a lot of paper.

Thus the idea for Plantr was born!

## The Solution

Plantr aims to let church admins take those who have signed up for these courses and create a database of contacts for the congregation in order to track
people's progress through the course. It also helps glean stats such as how long it takes individuals to complete a lesson and send it
back in, which questions seem to be causing the most confusion, and a way for members to reach out and encourage those who are taking
the course.

## Key Features
 * Database of contacts
 * Add/Edit/Delete contacts
 * Google Map integration pinpointing a contact's address
 * Submission/Viewing of lesson answers for record keeping
 
## Future Implementations
 * Full Google Map of every contact entered in the database for use in door knocking campaigns, mailing lists, etc.
 * Search/Filter of the database for easier use
 * Average time of completion per lesson among all contacts
 * Make the app responsive and mobile-friendly
 * Member login (currently only admin login available)
 * Notifications when contact information is updated
 * More customizable profile pages
